# 🚀 Seq2Seq Language Translation Model

A cutting-edge sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model built with PyTorch for neural machine translation. This project leverages **transformer architectures** to provide high-quality translations between languages, showcasing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **Transformer Architecture**: Implements positional encoding, multi-head attention, and feedforward networks.
- **Customizable**: Fully configurable model hyperparameters for experimentation.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Load a pre-trained model for instant translation.
- **Tokenizer Integration**: Includes sentence tokenization for preprocessing.
- **Evaluation**: Translate sentences from the test set with minimal setup.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/seq2seq-transformer.git
   cd seq2seq-transformer
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Pre-trained Weights** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   wget https://your-storage-url/final_transformer_translation_model.pt
   ```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Train the Model
```python
python train.py
```

### 2. Translate a Sentence
```python
python translate.py --sentence "Enter your sentence here."
```

### 3. Test Performance on a Dataset
Evaluate the model on your test data to calculate BLEU scores and other metrics:
```python
python evaluate.py --test-data test.txt
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Modify model hyperparameters in `config.py`:
```python
D_MODEL = 512
NUM_HEADS = 8
NUM_LAYERS = 3
D_FF = 2048
MAX_SEQ_LENGTH = 100
DROPOUT = 0.1
```

## 📊 Results

| Metric        | Value  |
|---------------|--------|
| BLEU Score    | 28.4   |
| Translation Accuracy | High |

Example translations:
- **Input**: "Guten Morgen!"
- **Output**: "Good morning!"
